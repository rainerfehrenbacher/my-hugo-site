Have you ever thought about donating blood, or blood plasma? Until this past year, I never thought very much about donating blood because I was (and still am) very afraid of needles.

Surely, donating blood was something that other people who were less needle-phobic would take care of for me.

Then, in 2022, a very close family member required multiple blood transfusions during a hospital stay due to their iron levels dropping dangerously low. After leaving the hospital, I felt like it was my responsibility to at least return the amount of blood that we'd accepted from the hospital. Pay it forward, you know?

So I started digging around the internet and found that the only collection site near where I live is a blood plasma donation center.

This is an hour darkness in which we must organize and fight to move our governments and our communities away from their unquestioning support of the Israeli government.
