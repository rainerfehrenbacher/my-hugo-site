What's happening in Gaza right now is a genocide. The United States and Canada are complicit in this genocide, and our tax dollars are being spent to wage a war of colonizer aggression.

This is an hour darkness in which we must organize and fight to move our governments and our communities away from their unquestioning support of the Israeli government.

If you are in the US, [call your representatives and demad a de-escalation and ceasefire](https://5calls.org/issue/israel-palestine-gaza-war-hamas-ceasefire/).

[Learn which companies support the Israeli government](https://bdscoalition.ca/boycott-list-of-shame/), and participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement.
